### Youtube scrapping! :)

Hi! This is our YouTube scrapping project. What we have done here is take comments written under a particular YouTube video using Selenium, use sklearn to turn said comments into numeric values, and visualize them on a 2D plane using Matplotlib, as well as using KMeans to generate clusters of familiar sentiments.

The video we used for this project is "Artificial intelligence and algorithms: pros and cons | DW Documentary (AI documentary)", a video uploaded by DW Documentary, which goes over the implications of various AI technologies in the modern day. We chose this video as it is a relevant topic, has a lot of comments, and has a variety of perspectives.
