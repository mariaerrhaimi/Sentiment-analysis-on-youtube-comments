### Youtube scrapping! :)

Hi! This is our YouTube scrapping project. What we have done here is take comments written under a particular YouTube video using Selenium, use sklearn to turn said comments into numeric values, and visualize them on a 2D plane using Matplotlib, as well as using KMeans to generate clusters of familiar sentiments.

The video we used for this project is "Artificial intelligence and algorithms: pros and cons | DW Documentary (AI documentary)", a video uploaded by DW Documentary, which goes over the implications of various AI technologies in the modern day. We chose this video as it is a relevant topic, has a lot of comments, and has a variety of perspectives.

You can find the code for this project here: https://github.com/cb-ds-9/ds-project-data-engineering-3/blob/Lucas-Maria/Untitled.ipynb

You can find the video we used here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0dMTAQM4cw

An older version of the project (old.ipynb) can be found in the folder this is located in, with step-by-step instructions and explanations.

We've also included a list of all of the comments we've collected. This can be found in the "comments.txt" file.

We hope you enjoy this project!
