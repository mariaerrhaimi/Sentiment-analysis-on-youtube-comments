It’s just interesting seeing how people who champion AI don’t often talk about the future problems it might create. They only talk about the current problems it’ll solve. I’m all for solving problems and I appreciate some of the assistance from AI. But I also know that solving one problem always leads to another problem.,1.704058786812428,-0.39762124045657077,1,0.5744933456801683

"As I watched I kept returning to the scene of the jaywalker and how he was reduced in social value without human action. It was chilling on multiple levels.

"Don't forget that Germans are being told, not to hit the breaks in certain situations throughout their driver's training, where self-preservation and avoiding to cause more harm through panic reactions during accidents are being emphasised. I think that the culture around driving itself, and how is it taught to a population, plays a huge role in decision making behind the wheels. Another example for this would be, that, during our training, we are being reassured to generally be able to trust any adult and local traffic participant to behave correctly, whereas children and seniors are being viewed as volatile animals whom you can expect to jump in front of your car at any time. Consequently, faults, mistakes and misbehaviour are indiscriminately accredited to the one at fault - in this case, the human jaywalker. With this in mind, the result of Germans' preference to not take action in this specific situation, can be, somewhat, logically explained.",11.47382251191021,2.048043824824394,2,-4.675705177592052

"Biological evolution itself is basically a self-diversifying algorithm for metabolism and behavior, so yes, algorithms definitely rule as far as life is concerned.  If we can quickly replicate the process digitally and produce the final product(s) physically, we could theoretically produce artificial intelligence pretty easily.  But if we were to successfully do that, the problem would be that, however artificial it may be, it is in fact intelligence and thus must be respected as such, meaning we can't simply put it to work for us however we please if it shows consciousness similar to our own.  A non-conscious machine with specific intelligence (specified applications) that can perfectly mimic human intellectual outputs would be the better way to go, since there is ultimately no practical purpose in creating new conscious life forms just to say that we can.  It would require a read-only mechanism to selectively convert the results of an artificial cognitive process (more predictive than creative) to mechanical actions.  This could certainly shorten the processing time from hypothesis to invention by outsourcing basic intermediate human cognitive functions that tend to be highly inefficient compared to the level of complexity of the desired outcome.  We wouldn't need a complete human-like artificial consciousness to do that.  Tailoring and applying where needed should be plenty.",16.26395333235652,5.463077613910813,2,-4.796670554162389

"We are translating everything humans already do into AI et al including cultural diff/bias. We are trying to get AI to be as good as human intuition.  I get that experience and habitual minds & actions of all sorts can be programmed, but when we lose the big aha in life it’s a sad day.  Intuition is so much more than programming even if programmers have been able to aha all sorts of ideas into existence.  And what do you propose people will go with all their spare time?  Solve works hunger, play computer games, have AI call mom, hug their kids — programmed? — or give into their own habitual/cultural practices— ignore, treat & spoil, love, educate, beat — even more with all this extra time & energy?

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) WITHOUT emotions would be the best invention in human history, making life infinitely better for us. HOWEVER, AI WITH emotions (fear, hate, love, lust, envy, etc.) would lead to the end of the human race in short order. AI with emotions would see humans as a threat as we have the power to turn it off. AI without emotions will never see humans as a threat as it won't even care if we switch it off or ask it to do something that could damage it. So PLEASE, continue with AI research but DON'T EVEN TRY to give AI ANY emotions - emotions would be POINTLESS for AI anyway, the only reason to try and give AI emotions would be a vanity point for the researcher to prove they could do it, so DON'T DO IT! AI doesn't need to ""think like a person"", it can just be able to reason and deduce things - humans are emotional ANIMALS that later developed intelligence. So skip the emotional animal side of intelligence in AI. ",13.295083411962665,4.889993762964889,2,-0.9806950212009445
